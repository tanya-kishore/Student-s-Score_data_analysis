# Student-s-Score_data_analysis

# Dataset Description:

The dataset comprises information on students' scores in three subjects (Math, Reading, and Writing) and various demographic variables including gender, parents' education, marital status, sports practice, study hours, and ethnicity.
Key Findings:

    Gender Distribution:
        The analysis indicates that there are more females represented in the dataset compared to males.

    Impact of Parents' Education:
        There is evidence suggesting that parents' education has an influence on their children's scores.

    Effect of Marital Status:
        The analysis suggests that there is little to no impact on students' scores based on their parents' marital status.

    Subject Performance:
        Math appears to be the weakest subject among the students.
        There are outliers present in all subjects, with math having outliers at 0.

    Sports Practice:
        The analysis indicates that sports practice has negligible impact on students' scores.

    Study Hours:
        There is a slight positive correlation between study hours and academic performance across all subjects. However, a direct causal relationship cannot be concluded solely based on this observation.

    Ethnicity Influence:
        Ethnicity seems to have some impact on students' marks, though the extent of this influence requires further investigation.

# Conclusion:

The analysis of the student scores dataset provides valuable insights into factors influencing academic performance. While certain variables such as gender and parental education demonstrate notable associations with students' scores, further investigation is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms fully. This analysis can serve as a foundation for implementing targeted interventions and policies aimed at improving educational outcomes for students.
